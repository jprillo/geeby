      I was making love to my wife and this Geeby thing showed up. It started watching us. At first I thought this was pretty messed up but after a while it was pretty cool. Now we sleep with the window open in case he comes back.

      Geeby convinced me my husband was cheating. I left him and took a bus to my mothers house. On the way a found a one hundred dollar bill. Turns out he wasnt cheating and is now with Geeby. I do have and extra 100 bucks though.
